# Azure Kinect DK Code Samples Repository

This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to use Microsoft's Azure Kinect DK Sensor and Body
Tracking SDKs.

For more information about the Azure Kinect DK and available documentation, see [Azure.com/Kinect](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kinect-dk/)

Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample.

## Building

Due to the samples being provided from various sources they may only build for Windows or Linux. To keep the barrier for adding new samples low we only require that the sample works in one place.

### Windows

If the project has Visual Studio solution open it and build. CMake is not currently supported for Windows, though we support the community expanding on this.

### Linux

For building with Linux, CMake is used. Build from a `git clone`, we do not support building from a ZIP file.

Install the prerequisites
```
apt install libk4abt1.1-dev
apt install libxi-dev
```

From the root of the git project
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja
```
